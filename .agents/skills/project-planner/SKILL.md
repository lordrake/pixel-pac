# Project Planner

Turn confirmed requirements into a safe, incremental implementation plan.

## Invocation Rules

- Use this skill whenever the user asks for an implementation plan, phases, or testable work items for a project-workflow task, even if they ask in natural language.
- Read `AGENTS.md` and `.project-workflow/guidance.md` if present, then follow the project-workflow managed block and CLI requirements.
- If the task folder does not exist, use `project-task` first so the CLI creates the required files and tracker row.
- If requirements are missing or unclear, use `project-requirements` or `project-clarify` before planning.
- Planning is a document workflow unless the CLI adds an explicit planner command.

## Required Files

- `.project-workflow/tasks/<TASK>/REQUIREMENTS.md`
- `.project-workflow/tasks/<TASK>/IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- `.project-workflow/TRACKER.md`
- `.project-workflow/CONSTITUTION.md` if present
- `AGENTS.md` and other repo instructions if present

## Workflow

1. Read requirements first and treat them as the source of truth.
2. If requirements are missing, unclear, or internally inconsistent, stop and use `project-requirements` or `project-clarify`.
3. Produce or update `IMPLEMENTATION.md` with:
   - `## User Story` at the top
   - `## Goal`
   - `## Approach`
   - `## Phases`
   - `## Tasks`
4. Assign or preserve stable acceptance criteria IDs (`AC1`, `AC2`, etc.) from
   `REQUIREMENTS.md` and the `## Acceptance Criteria` section in
   `IMPLEMENTATION.md`.
5. Make every task independently testable and outcome-based.
6. Map every task row to one or more AC IDs, and ensure every AC ID is covered
   by at least one task row.
7. Use this table shape for tasks:

```md
|  ID | Title | Description | Acceptance Criteria | User Verification | Status |
| --: | ----- | ----------- | ------------------- | ----------------- | ------ |
|   1 | <Outcome> | <What changes for the user/system?> | AC1: <observable pass/fail criteria> | <steps or command> | To Do |
```

8. Keep each table row on one physical line. Use `<br>` for multiple items
   inside a cell and escape literal `|` characters.
9. Include validation steps for each phase.
10. Run `./.project-workflow/cli/workflow task ready --id <TASK-ID>` after planning and before moving to `Plan Confirmed`; if it fails, fix the listed gaps or route to `project-clarify`.
11. Include QA/code review as the required gate after implementation validation
    and before completion.
12. Do not implement code during planning.
