# Project Epic

Manage proposal-first epic work under `.project-workflow/tasks/`.

## Invocation Rules

- Use this skill whenever the user asks for an epic, epic decomposition, proposed child work, approval of epic rows, or scaffolding an approved epic child task.
- Read `AGENTS.md` and `.project-workflow/guidance.md` if present, then follow the project-workflow managed block and CLI requirements.
- Use the local workflow CLI for every supported epic operation.
- Do not scaffold child task folders until the relevant epic tracker row is `Approved`.

## Workflows

Create a new epic:

```bash
./.project-workflow/cli/workflow epic init --title "<TITLE>"
```

Decompose an epic into proposed child rows only:

```bash
./.project-workflow/cli/workflow epic decompose --epic-id <EPIC-ID> --limit 5 --type Task
```

Approve one proposed child row:

```bash
./.project-workflow/cli/workflow epic approve --epic-id <EPIC-ID> --id <TASK-ID>
```

Scaffold one approved child row:

```bash
./.project-workflow/cli/workflow epic scaffold-child --epic-id <EPIC-ID> --id <TASK-ID>
```

Scaffold one approved child row with a branch from an existing epic branch:

```bash
./.project-workflow/cli/workflow epic scaffold-child --epic-id <EPIC-ID> --id <TASK-ID> --create-branch --epic-branch <EPIC-BRANCH>
```

Move one epic tracker row through lifecycle statuses:

```bash
./.project-workflow/cli/workflow epic status --epic-id <EPIC-ID> --id <TASK-ID> --to Testing
./.project-workflow/cli/workflow epic status --epic-id <EPIC-ID> --id <TASK-ID> --to Review
./.project-workflow/cli/workflow epic status --epic-id <EPIC-ID> --id <TASK-ID> --to Complete
```

Generate an epic acceptance audit:

```bash
./.project-workflow/cli/workflow epic audit --epic-id <EPIC-ID>
```

Validate epic requirements before decomposition:

```bash
./.project-workflow/cli/workflow epic ready --epic-id <EPIC-ID>
```

Validate one child task before implementation/testing:

```bash
./.project-workflow/cli/workflow epic ready-child --epic-id <EPIC-ID> --id <TASK-ID>
```

Validate epic closeout, optionally completing the global epic row when gates pass:

```bash
./.project-workflow/cli/workflow epic closeout --epic-id <EPIC-ID> [--complete]
```

## Rules

- `epic init` creates an epic `REQUIREMENTS.md` and epic `TRACKER.md`.
- Epic acceptance criteria should use stable IDs (`AC1`, `AC2`, etc.).
- `epic ready` must pass before decomposition; if it fails, ask the owner only for missing product decisions/context and record answers in `REQUIREMENTS.md`.
- `epic decompose` writes Proposed child rows only and does not create child task folders.
- Proposed child rows should preserve source AC IDs in the epic tracker `Parent ACs` field when they come from numbered acceptance criteria. Legacy trackers may still carry coverage in `Notes` as `Covers AC1, AC3`.
- `epic approve` moves a child row from `Proposed` to `Approved`.
- `epic scaffold-child` only accepts `Approved` child rows and moves them to `In Progress` after scaffold.
- `epic status` moves child rows through `Testing`, `Review`, and `Complete`; `Complete` requires QA/code-review evidence and parent AC evidence.
- Scaffolded epic child task docs must include parent AC coverage and parent AC evidence sections. Their implementation plans must map every task row to one or more stable child AC IDs and keep the parent AC mapping visible.
- `epic ready-child` must pass before implementation/testing; if it fails, remediate missing child requirements, planning, validation, parent AC coverage, or owner decisions first.
- The global tracker summarizes epic rows; the epic tracker owns child rows. Proposed child rows must stay in the epic tracker and must not be added to the global tracker.
- `epic audit` writes `ACCEPTANCE-AUDIT.md` with parent AC coverage, child evidence, deferrals, and verdicts.
- `epic closeout` must block if any parent AC is unmapped, lacks evidence, lacks a QA pass verdict, or lacks an approved deferral with follow-up.
- Child IDs remain globally unique `TASK-###` IDs across standalone and epic-managed work.
- When `--create-branch` is used, the epic branch must already exist; do not fall back to a base branch.
- After any epic tracker or child scaffold change, run `./.project-workflow/cli/workflow doctor` and report workflow-state warnings or errors.
