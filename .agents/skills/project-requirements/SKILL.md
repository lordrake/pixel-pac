# Project Requirements

Capture what is being built before planning or coding.

Project Workflow is owner-directed and agent-operated. The owner provides product context and decisions conversationally; the agent extracts them into workflow artifacts and asks focused questions only when needed.

## Invocation Rules

- Use this skill whenever the user asks for requirements, scope, acceptance criteria, open questions, decisions, or a validation plan, even if they ask in natural language.
- Read `AGENTS.md` and `.project-workflow/guidance.md` if present, then follow the project-workflow managed block and CLI requirements.
- If the task folder does not exist, use `project-task` first so the CLI creates the required files and tracker row.
- After the task exists, requirements capture is a document workflow unless the CLI adds an explicit requirements command.

## Required Files

- `.project-workflow/tasks/<TASK>/REQUIREMENTS.md`
- `.project-workflow/tasks/<TASK>/IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- `.project-workflow/CONSTITUTION.md` if present
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` or `AGENTS.md` if present

## Workflow

1. Identify the task folder. If it does not exist, use `project-task` first.
2. Read existing `REQUIREMENTS.md` and the `## User Story` section of `IMPLEMENTATION.md`.
3. If the feature or bugfix is not clear, ask only for discovery context: what change, where in the product, who is affected, and what success looks like.
   Minimum context should cover problem/opportunity, desired outcome, affected user or system, scope boundaries, acceptance signal, constraints, priority/risk, and examples or failure modes.
4. Draft or update `REQUIREMENTS.md` with:
   - Overview
   - User Story
   - Goal
   - Non-Goals
   - Users & Context
   - Outcome-focused requirements
   - Verifiable acceptance criteria with stable IDs (`AC1`, `AC2`, etc.)
   - Open questions
   - Resolved decisions
   - Validation plan
5. Preserve existing AC IDs when requirements change. Do not renumber existing
   ACs unless the user explicitly approves the requirements change.
6. Keep only the `## User Story` section in `IMPLEMENTATION.md` synced with `REQUIREMENTS.md`. Do not add implementation tasks here.
7. If critical requirements are ambiguous, record them as open questions in `REQUIREMENTS.md`, then ask the user the minimum questions needed.
8. Do not proceed to planning or implementation until open questions are resolved or explicitly accepted as risks and recorded.
9. If the work is intentionally exploratory, record it as discovery with a question, decision enabled, boundary, output artifact, and validation signal.
